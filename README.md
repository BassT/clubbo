### Getting started

Clubbo requires that [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com) is installed.

You can run it locally like this:

```
clone https://github.com/BassT/clubbo.git
cd clubbo
meteor
```

Demo admins and users are already set up, see `server/fixtures.js`.

You can also deploy it to Heroku for free using [Meteor Buildpack Horse](https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse).

Unfortunately the tests are deprecated for now.

### Important packages

Routing: [Iron Router](http://iron-meteor.github.io/iron-router/)

Templating: [Blaze](https://guide.meteor.com/blaze.html)

Authorization: [Roles](https://github.com/alanning/meteor-roles)

Database schema: [Collection2](https://github.com/aldeed/meteor-collection2)
